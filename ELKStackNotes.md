# ELK Notes
## **Introduction**
In this repository I go over the monitoring tool ELK stack

ELK comes in 5 parts, they are:
1. Elasticsearch
2. Logstash
3. Kibana
4. FileBeat
5. MeticBeat

### **Elasticsearch**

This is the main node that contains all the analytics. We are able to preform queries on the data.

### **Logstash**

This is the server side processing pipeline that formats the data.

### **Kibana**

Kibana is the server that allows us to see that data and navigate elastic stack.

### **Filebeat and Meticbeat**

The parts on the nodes that record all the logs and commands to send to logstash
